## Property-Alliance

This is the home page of a new effort to create a meta-model for Java.
The goal is to include the meta-model in Java SE, to replace `java.beans`.

A meta-model provides a standard way to examine, create and modify objects.
It can be thought of as version 2.0 of the JavaBeans specification.

This site is relatively simple - a collection of pages discussing the problem.
There is also some [code](https://github.com/jodastephen/property-alliance).
